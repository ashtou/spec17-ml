# spec17-ml

Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Performance Prediction of  SPEC CPU2017 Benchmarks

## Installation

- ### Install Python3.8 venv

  `sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv`

- ### Create a clean virtual environment and activate

  `python -m venv ./venv`

  `source venv/bin/activate`

  for some packages you may need to install to install the python dev:

  `sudo apt-get install python3.8-dev`

- ### Install project dependencies

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
